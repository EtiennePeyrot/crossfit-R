Description: Provides a general cross-fitting engine for double /
    debiased machine learning and other meta-learners. The core
    functions implement flexible graphs of nuisance models with
    per-node training fold widths, target-specific evaluation
    windows, and several fold allocation schemes ("independence",
    "overlap", "disjoint"). The engine supports both numeric
    estimators (mode = "estimate") and cross-fitted prediction
    functions (mode = "predict"), with configurable aggregation
    over panels and repetitions.
