\title{Internal: indices used for nuisance training}
\usage{
obs_for_train(train_token, K, fold_idx, plan, methods)
}
\arguments{
\item{train_token}{A training token created by
\code{\link{make_train_token}}.}

\item{K}{Total number of folds.}

\item{fold_idx}{A list mapping fold labels \code{1:K} to integer row
indices.}

\item{plan}{The cross-fitting plan as returned by
\code{build_instances()}.}

\item{methods}{The methods list used to build \code{plan}.}
}
\value{
A list with components \code{idx} (row indices) and
\code{folds} (fold labels).
}
\description{
Given a training token and the cross-fitting plan, returns the row
indices and fold labels used to train a given nuisance instance. The
training window is determined by the instance-specific offset and
\code{train_fold} value.
