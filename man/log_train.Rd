\title{Internal logging utilities}
\usage{
log_train(inst, token, folds)

log_pred(inst, token, folds, insts)
}
\arguments{
\item{inst}{An instance descriptor from the internal plan object.}

\item{token}{A token created by \code{make_eval_token()} or
\code{make_train_token()}, indicating the method index and panel.}

\item{folds}{Integer vector of fold indices involved in the
operation.}

\item{insts}{List of all instances (for \code{log_pred()} only),
used to resolve the goal of the prediction.}
}
\value{
These functions are called for their side-effect (printing);
they return \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
These helpers print training and prediction schedules for debugging
the cross-fitting plan. Logging is controlled by the global
\code{show_log} flag: when \code{show_log} is \code{TRUE}, both
\code{log_train()} and \code{log_pred()} write messages to the console.
