\title{crossfit: Cross-Fitting Engine for Double / Debiased Machine Learning}
\description{
Provides a general cross-fitting engine for double / debiased machine
learning and other meta-learners. The core functions implement flexible
graphs of nuisance models with per-node training fold widths, target-specific
evaluation windows, and several fold allocation schemes ("independence",
"overlap", "disjoint"). The engine supports both numeric estimators
(mode = "estimate") and cross-fitted prediction functions (mode = "predict"),
with configurable aggregation over panels and repetitions.
